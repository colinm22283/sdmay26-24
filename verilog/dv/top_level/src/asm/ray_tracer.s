#include "defs.s"

; Performs a path trace of a single ray in a scene.
; Assumes all models have been multiplied by their model
; matrices and all triangles have normal vectors calculated
; beforehand. These aren't unreasonable preprocess steps and
; will greatly help performance. It can even be done using
; a separate shader program.

; The following global registers must be
; preloaded by the management core:
; g0 -> g2: camera position
; g3 -> g5: image plane x vector: (0, 0) at top left of screen
; g6 -> g8: image plane y vector
; g43: max ray depth
; g44: &framebuffer[0][0]
; g45: num_triangles (length of index buffer)
; g46: &index_buffer[0]
; g47: &vertex_buffer[0]

; NOTE: Ideally, we have a random number generator to
; randomize ray bounces. As of now we don't, so it'll be
; deterministic (based off of tid and pixel)

; Triangles must be of the form: struct { u32 idx0, u32 idx1, u32 idx2, u32 norm_x, u32 norm_y, u32 norm_z }.
; Vectors must be of the form: struct { u32 x, u32 y, u32 z, u8 color }.
; No texturing supported, we don't have enough registers.
